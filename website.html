          I was born in the Philippines and into a family of 5. 
          I am the youngest of my family and we moved to Canada in 2005.
          From a young age I was interested in brain teasers like chess and puzzles. 
          Some personal hobbies of mine are snowboarding, gaming, and traveling.

            As I got older, I got into computers and built one of my own. 
            At present, I have graduated Brock University with a Computer Science Degree with a Minor in Mathematics. 
            Currently, I am working on my skills and projects. 
            While I prefer to work as a back-end developer, I am expanding my skill set in case it is ever needed. 
            I am open to any developing job and would love to be in contact!

            My progamming languages are Python, C++, SQL, and Java. Through my studies, I have written most of my academic projects

            Some of my notable academic works is the Canada Games Chatbot Project.
            With a large group of peers, a Chatbot application was made using a variety of languages. 
            The Agile process was used to plan and implement user requirements. 
            A Mongo dB database, python script, and React app was used for a tokenized chatbot application.
